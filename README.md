Creating a Github site
Create an account on Github.com
Go to settings and click your repositories
Create a new repository by clicking green new button
Title your repository (your username).github.io, make it public and click create repository
Go to settings and click pages
Go to where it says source and choose the appropriate branch and folder setting and save it
    (By doing the (your username).github.io repository naming convention in step 4
     and doing step 6 you to will now be able to host your HTML on the browser from Github)
Create a folder on your computer for your website
Go to Visual Studio Code and create a new index.html file in the new folder
    The file should look something like this:
        <html>
                <h1>Keith's Website</h1>
                <img src="githubpicture.jpeg"/>
                <p>Keith is learning web development</p>
        </html>
Add any additional image files to the same folder as index if needed like in my HTML file
Go back to your repository and click the hyperlink "uploading an existing file"
Drag your folder to where it says drag files to add them to your repository, or you can choose your files
When all of your files or folders are added to your repository click the green commit changes button 
If you want to just see your Github repository the URL will be github.com/<github username>/<repository name>
If you want to see your HTML be hosted on the browser the URL will be (your username).github.io/index.html
